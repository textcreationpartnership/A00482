            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N Wedneſdaye beeing the <hi>30,</hi> of <hi>October, Iohn Slade,</hi> ſomtime a Scholemaiſter, was drawen vpon a Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the priſon in <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> to the market place where the execution was appointed: and being come to the aforeſaid place, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the Hurdell, he came and kneeled downe by the gallowes, making a croſſe with his hande vppon one of the poaſtes therof, and kiſſed it, vſing ſilent Prayers in latine to him ſelfe. Afterward, being come vpon the ladder, he beganne in this maner. I am come hither this day to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death for my faith, what faith? no rare faith, but euen the faith that hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from all poſterities: Wherupon Sir <hi>William Kingſmell</hi> Knight, ſpake to him, as thus: <hi>Slade,</hi> doe not thus delude the People with plauſible ſpeeches, you

You haue denyed her maieſtie to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſupremacie ouer the Church of Chriſt in <hi>England,</hi> both in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall and temporall, which fact is high treaſon: &amp; therfore you are worthy to ſuffer death, in that you will not giue her maieſtie her dutie and your allegeaunce. Oh Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> (quoth he) I will giue her maieſtie as mutche as euer hath beene giuen to any Prince in this Realme, &amp; wil ſhew her as much dutie, as he that is her moſt obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Subiect. That do you not (anſwered Sir <hi>William Kingſmell</hi>) for you rob her of her Eccleſiaſtical and temporal gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which all Princes hath enioyed, and you traiterouſly take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her: therfore how do you giue her as much as any Prince hath had, and howe doe you ſhowe your ſelfe a ſubiect, in this vnnaturall dealing, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a forraine gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, before your owne lawfull Queene, Sir (ſayd <hi>Slade</hi>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 31 -->the ſupremacie hath &amp; doth belong to the Pope by right, euen as from <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; the Pope hath receiued it by diuin prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: therefore we muſt not giue thoſe thinges belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to god, to any other then him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: and becauſe I wil not do otherwiſe, I may ſaye with the three Children in the firie Ouen, and the firſt of the Widowes ſeuen Sonnes in the <hi>Maccabees.

At theſe words, M. <hi>Doctor Bennet,</hi> one of the Chaplains to the right honorable the Lord Treaſourer, came to him and ſayd: <hi>Slade,</hi> do not abuſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thus, with theſe wordes: <hi>Paule</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> were put to death for religion, they were commaunded not to preach in the name of Ieſus, are you commaunded any ſuch thing? Oh Sir (anſwered <hi>Slade</hi>) I would

               <!-- PDF PAGE 32 -->wiſh you to behaue your ſelf after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Trewant, whoſe nature is to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, and ſo would I haue you forget your wicked life, &amp; begin a new. <hi>Slade</hi> (ſaid M. <hi>Bennet</hi>) I come as one that wiſheth well to thy ſoule, thou art now at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pits brink, conſider how highly thou offendeſt God, and likewiſe howe thou haſt trangreſſed againſt her Maieſtie: I deſire thee in the bowelles of Chriſt be not ſo wilfull, looſe not that ſo lightly, which he hath bought with his moſt pretious blood. And if my wordes may not preuaile with thee, yet for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of thine owne ſoule, forſake this damnable opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let not that vnworthie Prieſt be preferred before thine own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Princeſſe, who is the lawful ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me head of the church, next vnder Chriſt.

<pb facs="tcp:17140:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 32 -->but only the Pope, and her Maieſtie hath no authoritie in te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall cauſes (likewiſe) but only what hee ſhall thinke good to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her. At theſe words, the people cried, away with the Traitour, hang him, ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g him. Maiſter Sherife willed him againe to aſke her Maieſtie forgiuenes. Why ſhould I aſke her forgiuenes (quoth hee) wherein haue I offended her? Then M. <hi>Bennet</hi> deſired him to commend his ſoule to God, and deſire the people to praye for him, but he ſayd, they and hee were not of one faith, &amp; therfore they ſhould not pray for him, &amp; I deſire al bleſſed people (quoth he) to pray for me, and all the Saintes &amp; bleſſed Companie of Heauen. So after he had ſtaied ſo long as it pleaſed himſelf and had mumbled a many latine praiers ſilently to himſelf, he was caſt beſide the ladder, and afterward was cut downe &amp; quartered, according to his Iudgement.</p>
